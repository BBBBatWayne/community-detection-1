# community-detection

Study various community detection algorithm and then developled an improved version
of famous Girvan-Newman CDA. Implemented the concept of local maxima of modularity to
reduce the number of operations during computation of communities. I've completed the 
project and developed a new algortihm that's influened by Girvan-Newman CDA.
